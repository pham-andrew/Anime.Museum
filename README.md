In the main room you'll find prop replicas aligned with art from their respective anime. All the prop replicas are existing licensed products we have 3D scanned or placeholders for props we hope to acquire and scan in the future.

### Back Room

Outside you will find a collection of various informational exhibits on animation showcases, keyframes, musical breakdown, subbing/dubbing, and others. The outside exhibits facing the main room relate to the nearby section of the main room.

## Acquisition / Scanning Efforts

Efforts are currently underway to 3D scan Zero's helmet from "Code Geass". The museum has is acquiring a proplica of Tengen Uzui's Nichirin swords and Arthur's excalibur to scan. The museum desires to acquire a divergence meter from "Steins;Gate"; however, very few of these were made. If anyone has a divergence meter they'd be willing to loan the museum for scanning, please contact us.

## FAQ

### Why would I go to a museum when I can just watch anime in the proper medium from my PC?
Discover pieces of shows or history. Take a moment to reflect on animation style, character design, music, and other cinematic elements. See the prop replicas in person (one day when this becomes a physical exhibit).

### Why are some pieces on the wall so small?
Some of the artwork on the wall is based off of a physical piece in the collection, such as prints, storyboards, or keyframes. They are shown in accurate to their size in the virtual museum.

### How do I move in the virual museum?
WASD to move, drag left click to look.
